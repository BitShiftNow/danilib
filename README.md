# danilib

A collection of my personal single-file C libraries I use to develop my applications.
The only dependency for most of these files is the base header which contains all base types and helper macros.
If a file has any other dependencies they will be listed in the comment section at the beginning of the file.


## Platforms

All these files are specifically written for the `Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.38.33134 for x64` and have only been tested on `Windows 11 Home 64-bit - 22H2 - 22621.3296`. 


## How to use

Simply select the library you would like and copy it to your projects source code folder. Additional configuration can be done by either editing the file or by supplying known definitions before including. See each files comment section at the beginning of the file to find out more about all the different available configurations.


## Libraries

The following libraries are available:

| Library | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| dani_base.h | Contains base types and helper macros that is used by all other library files. |


## License

Each library has licence information included at the end of the file. It is a modified BSD licence which gives you a lot of freedom on how to use the code. If you get any use out of these libraries please consider donating to the creator at https://ko-fi.com/danicrunch
